# wiitools
Wiitools, release coming soon.

# Requirements
* Python (version 10.6 or above should be good.)
* Dolphin (Anything released 2021 or later should be good.)
I recommend that you use dolphin as a Wii emulator if you are planning on using the files wiitools give you. Wiitools is made with dolphin in mind, so other emulators will probably not work.

# Source Documentation
Alright, lets start first with what the files in the downloadables folder are.
* RVL-NigaoeNR-v6.wad = Mii channel boot file
