# wiitools
Wiitools, release coming soon.

# Features
* Decoding and encoding save files for NSMBW.
* Downloading wii bootables (.wad) files, like the Mii channel and the wii menu.

# Requirements
* Python (version 10.6 or above should be good.)
* Dolphin (Anything released 2021 or later should be good.)
I recommend that you use dolphin as a Wii emulator if you are planning on using the files wiitools give you. Wiitools is made with dolphin in mind, so other emulators will probably not work.

# Save File Decoder / Encoder
Here is a quick guide on how to use the save file decoder / encoder.
* Open the window.
* Put the name of the save file into the textbox (needs to be name + extension for example: savefile.sav and the save file needs to be located in the same folder as the py script.)
* Make sure the game is actually supported.
* Press the decompile button.
* A new file will be made called "(nameofyoursavehere).txt" (nameofyoursavehere) is the name of the inputted save file.
* Open the file and enjoy.
If you want to encode it back you need to follow these steps.
* Open the window.
* Put the name of the decompiled file in the textbox (example: (nameofyoursavehere).txt)
* Press compile.
* There will be a new file created named "(nameofyoursavehere).txt".

# Source Documentation
Alright, lets start first with what the files in the downloadables folder are.
* RVL-NigaoeNR-v6.wad = Mii channel boot file.
